          <p class="blog-post-date">September 17, 2024</p>
        </header>

        <div class="blog-post-content">
          <p>One recurring question I often get is, "How do you envision your efforts making a global impact?" My answer is simple: I don't. I'm a Buddhist, and I think small.</p>

          <p>Thinking small allows me to treasure the fleeting beauty in everyday moments and focus on the minute task at hand. It's in the small, deliberate actions that true change begins. Over time, the impact unfolds like a ripple on a lake, gradually touching more lives than I could have anticipated. This journey, from the personal to the interconnected, is the story of how I see the world &ndash; and it all starts in my backyard.</p>

          <h2>The Power of a Personal Connection</h2>
          <p>Everything I've accomplished has started with a personal connection, that first small step. It's never been about grand, sweeping gestures; instead, it's been about nurturing relationships that feel close to home.</p>

          <p>Years ago, my efforts began in Richmond, California, in an area known as the Iron Triangle. It was my backyard, both literally and figuratively. What drew me in wasn't the thought of changing the world but an admiration for individuals in the community whose values and passions aligned with mine. Their resilience, their dedication to education and art, their desire to build a better life &ndash; these were the sparks that inspired me.</p>

          <p>At first, my involvement was small. I listened, learned, and understood the challenges they faced. I supported their endeavors in the arts, education, and cultural preservation. Over time, I saw how our combined efforts could lead to positive change, not just for individuals but for the entire community. It wasn't about chasing a global movement; it was about the care and attention given to each person right in front of me.</p>

          <h2>The Ripple Effect of Small Actions</h2>
          <p>Much like throwing a pebble into a lake, each small step I've taken has created a ripple effect. What began as local projects in Richmond expanded in ways I couldn't have foreseen. Twenty years later, my "backyard" has extended beyond California to places like Ghana and Ethiopia.</p>

          <p>For example, in Ghana, I became involved with a music school that shares the universal language of music with children in underserved communities. I was introduced to the school through personal relationships &ndash; again, a small beginning that led to a broader connection. It wasn't about making an immediate global impact. It was about supporting a cause that resonated with me, one step at a time. The ripple effect of this involvement now reaches across continents.</p>

          <p>Ethiopia followed a similar path. The project began with a simple admiration for an immigrant "rags-to-riches" philanthropist whose passion for uplifting women aligned with mine. Our collaboration started slowly, feeding homeless people in the Bay Area. Twenty years later, I now work with her to support a women's shelter in Ethiopia. The shelter provides a safe home for up to one hundred women, helping them obtain an education and secure a career.</p>

          <p>These projects weren't aimed at transforming the world overnight, but rather at helping one person, one community at a time.</p>

          <p>This is how I view global impact &ndash; not as a large, sweeping change but as the interconnectedness of all of our "backyards." The relationships I've nurtured and the projects I've supported have grown, rippling out to touch more people than I ever imagined.</p>

          <h2>Treasuring the Everyday</h2>
          <p>Thinking small allows me to savor the beauty in the everyday. Life is fleeting, and moments of joy and connection can easily pass unnoticed if we're always chasing something bigger, something grander. By focusing on the present moment, I find peace and purpose in the work I do.</p>

          <p>This mindset extends to every project I take on. Whether it's helping to fund local artists or partnering with educators in different parts of the world, I remind myself that it's the small steps that matter most. The simple act of listening, of showing up for someone, of offering support without expectation of grand results &ndash; these are the moments that bring true beauty and meaning to life.</p>

          <p>Buddhism teaches that the present moment is all we truly have, and this resonates deeply with me. When I think small, I'm not worried about whether my actions will one day be seen as "world-changing." Instead, I focus on the immediate task at hand, trusting that the ripple effect will come in its own time, in its own way.</p>

          <h2>Interconnected and Interdependent: The Global Backyard</h2>
          <p>Is this the "global impact" people talk about? I don't know. What I do know is that the world is interconnected and interdependent &ndash; it's all my backyard. The idea of "global" is no longer a distant, abstract concept but a reflection of the connections we nurture right where we are.</p>

          <p>By focusing on the people in front of me and helping where I can, I've learned that we are all part of the same intricate web. My efforts in Richmond are connected to the music school in Ghana, which ties to the women's shelter in Ethiopia, which links to global forced migration issues, and ultimately connects to the KAVAH Fermata Fellowship, our project at the University of Chicago. Each project and each connection is part of the same fabric, woven together by small acts of care and attention.</p>

          <h2>Embrace the Beauty of Thinking Small</h2>
          <p>Thinking small isn't about limiting ourselves or our impact. It's about recognizing that the most profound change often starts with the simplest of actions &ndash; a conversation, a connection, a shared vision.</p>

          <p>Over the past two decades, I've seen how focusing on the small, everyday moments can lead to a broader, more interconnected world. My "backyard" has grown, but the philosophy remains the same. Whether it's supporting local artists in California or working with educators in Africa, the goal is not to achieve some abstract notion of global impact but to be present, to care, and to act with intention.</p>

          <p>In thinking small, I've found a deep sense of fulfillment and purpose. The world may be vast, but it's also close, intimate, and connected. Every small action, every personal connection, creates a ripple. And as those ripples spread, they join with others, forming something far larger than any one person could achieve alone.</p>

          <p>So, if there's one message I want to share, it's this: Don't underestimate the power of thinking small. It's in those moments of quiet focus and personal connection that real beauty and lasting impact are found. The world, after all, is just one big, interconnected backyard.</p>
